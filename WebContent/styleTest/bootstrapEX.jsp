				<h2>Bolton Walked Back Syria Statement. His Disdain for Debate
					Helped Produce It.</h2>
				<p>WASHINGTON — John R. Bolton found himself last weekend in a
					familiar but dangerous spot: cleaning up after his boss announced
					the withdrawal of 2,000 troops from Syria — a decision that rattled
					allies and threw America’s Middle East policy into turmoil. But Mr.
					Bolton is at least partly responsible for the conditions that led
					to President Trump’s sudden move. As the president’s national
					security adviser, Mr. Bolton has largely eliminated the internal
					policy debates that could have fleshed out the troop decision with
					timetables, conditions and a counterterrorism strategy for after
					the troops leave. Under Mr. Bolton’s management, senior
					administration officials said, the National Security Council staff
					had “zero” role in brokering a debate over America’s future in
					Syria. Mr. Bolton, officials said, was surprised by the timing of
					Mr. Trump’s announcement, which contradicted his own pledge in
					September to keep American troops in Syria. Faced with the
					president’s abrupt declaration, which drew howls of protest from
					Congress and concerned phone calls from allies like Prime Minister
					Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Bolton felt compelled to talk his
					boss into slowing down the process, these officials said.</p>
